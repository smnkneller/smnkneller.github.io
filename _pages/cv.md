Hi, my name is Simon.

I'm currently working as Head of Industrial Analytics & IoT at [esentri AG](https://www.esentri.com/). I spend my time partly on leading and continually developing a full stack Data Science team responsible for generating real value through industrial data. This includes getting data from sensors to the cloud, performing data transformation task in stream or batch pipelines, experimentation & causal inference as well as building new data products for our customers. Besides leading the team I work as a Senior Data Science Consultant at our customers projects building and deploying machine learning solutions myself. The industries I did projects for are mainly manufacturing and infrastucture.

I strongly believe that key to success of data science projects is an end-to-end approach. That means domain experts, data engineers, data scientist and MLOps have to work seamlessly togehter. There is no such thing like a handover of the "data package" between the data engineer and the data scientist or the "algorithm package" between the data scientist and MLOps. Of course, there cannot be the one person that unites all the knowledge of these roles in depth, but I think each role has to go beyond its role definition to understand each other in the team and take the right decisions. And that's what I'm trying to do continuously: I would call myself home in the role of the data scientist from where I expand my knowledge in the data engineering and MLOps area.


About this site
======
There are three main reasons for me operating this website:
- Writing forces sharper understanding. I believe there is a huge difference between writing down notes just for myself and writing something down that is supposed to be understandable for everyone (at least with the necessary technical background) in terms of quality and long term repoducability.
- Feeling the pressure of getting things written down from time to time helps me to cut down longterm projects into logical milestones. I believe that's enriching for the project itself as well as helpful for memorizing its technical main diffiulties afterwards.
- When it comes to specific technical problems my sources number one are blogpost and discussions in technical forums. I hope I can also contibute a little bit with this website.
