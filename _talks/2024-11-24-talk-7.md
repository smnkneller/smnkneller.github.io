At KSB SE & Co. KGaA, the number of productive ML-models increased with the growing customer base of its digital product KSB Guard. As a result, the need for a clear separation of responsibilities between data scientists and operations increased. In particular, the further development of already productive models became a pain point. In this talk I presented a service architecture that promotes seamless collaboration between data science and operations teams.
