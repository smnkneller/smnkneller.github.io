In this talk I worked out some talkeaways regarding MLOPS from one of our customer projects:
Firstly, a clear understanding of the importance of MLOps for the long-term operation of machine learning models. Secondly, I  gave Insight into which problems AWS Sagemaker can and cannot solve (model registry, multi-model endpoints, serverless endpoints,...). Finally, I conveyed an understanding of a service architecture that promotes seamless collaboration between data science and operations teams.
