In this talk I worked out the following takeaways regarding ML Ops:
- Clear understanding of the importance of MLOps for the long-term operation of machine learning models
- Insight into which problems AWS Sagemaker can and cannot solve (model registry, multi-model endpoints, serverless endpoints,...)
- Understanding of a service architecture that promotes seamless collaboration between data science and operations teams
