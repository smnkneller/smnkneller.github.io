For one of our customers in the mechanical engineering sector, the growing number of productive machine learning models increased the need for a clear separation of responsibilities between data scientists and operations and thus also for clear ML OPS practices. In particular, the further development of already productive models became a pain point.
Therefore, we have gradually introduced various AWS Sagemaker services that solve the above-mentioned problems. In this talk I worked out the following takeaways regarding ML Ops:
- Clear understanding of the importance of MLOps for the long-term operation of machine learning models
- Insight into which problems AWS Sagemaker can and cannot solve (model registry, multi-model endpoints, serverless endpoints,...)
- Understanding of a service architecture that promotes seamless collaboration between data science and operations teams
