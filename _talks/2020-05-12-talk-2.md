In this talk, I give some insights about a Data Science project I did at TAL Group. TAG Group is a pipeline operator that transports crude oil from the Mediteranean Sea all over the alps to different rafineries in Austria, Germany and Czech Republic. Therefore many pumps are operating all along the pipeline and in this project we identified inefficies and its root causes using Machine Learning.
